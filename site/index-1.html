							Amcha Ghar accepts orphaned, semi-orphaned, neglected and abandoned girls. We work with rejected children, orphans who do not know their origin, children of commercial sex workers, children abused by their relatives, children who have witnessed the suicide of family members, and children deserted due to poverty and hardship. Some girls’ parents have contracted HIV/AIDS and are unable to care for them, although the girls themselves do not have HIV.<br>
</p><p>
Some were sold to brothels in other states, expected to suffer the pain in silence; others resorted to glue-sniffing to escape daily physical and emotional duress. These children are often found in unhygienic conditions on streets and beaches, or in parks, parking lots, or slums.<br>
</p><p>
Girls generally come to Amcha Ghar after five years of age, although exceptions are made for emergencies. We provide a safe, loving environment to support their growth until they have completed their education and/or vocational training and can provide for themselves as successful adult women.<br>

							</p></p>

                            <p>For the majority of street children, street life seems to them to be their only means of survival. As girls, they are exposed to pimps, violence, sexual abuse and communities that despise them through lack of understanding of their experiences and reasons for coming to the streets.
							</p><p>
							<br>

Rescuing children from the dangerous environment of the streets and offering them access to a safe environment is only the first step on the long road to recovery, but it is nonetheless a crucial one.</p><p><br>

Through our dedicated team of field social workers and well wishers, including the Mumbai police, we offer children wishing to make a break from street life the opportunity to do so. At the ‘Home’, the staff undertakes the identification and rehabilitation process of each child in order to understand and address their individual needs.</p><p><br>

We offer family counseling and parental job placement assistance, with the ultimate aim of strengthening the families so that girls can be reunited with their parents.
